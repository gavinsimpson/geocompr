Random notes:

1. "(Semi-)Parametric regression techniques" - you use terms (e.g. semi-parametric) without any introduction/explanation. I suggest to replace it with "Statistical modeling techniques".
2. "which is probably familiar to most readers" - I think we should not use statements like this one. I suggest to remove it.
3. "CV determines a modelâ€™s ability to predict new data or differently put its ability to generalize." This sentence doesn't sound right...
4. "CV achieves this by splitting the data randomly into test and training sets." Is it always true? CV can also splitting the data in a non-random fashion, e.g. stratified sample, etc.
5. "To make the ratio between landslide and non-landslide points more balanced, we randomly sample 175 from the 1360 non-landslide points." Probably it is a good idea to add a set.seed here to be able to reproduce this...
6. Creation on the dem object is complex and probably unnecessary here. Maybe we could add this raster object to spDataLarge?
7. "`log_carea`: the decadic logarithm of the catchment area (log m^2^)". Is it log or log10)?
8. "Later on we will introduce the mlr package, an umbrella-package providing a unified interface to a plethora of modeling approaches." Should we use words like "plethora" in our book?
9. Commented code `# the same as:
# fit = glm(lslpts ~ ., data = select(lsl, -x, -y))` - I think this code can be removed. It just add some confusion.
10. "# loading among others ta, a raster stack containing the predictors" - is it a temporary solution? We should have this in our data packages or it should be calculated in the previous chunks...
11. "There are three main directions:". I suggest rewriting those three points. The first two are very short and the other one is much longer. Moreover, the first point is written like a description ("The predictions (...) are ..."), the second one is an action ("Adding ..."), and the third one is a suggestion ("(...) there are").
12. "the most beautiful prediction map " What does it mean? I think this sentence should be rewritten.
13. "AUROC" - I am surprised by this abbreviation. Isn't usually "AUC"?
14. "Figure 13.4" - Should we ask for the permission to use this figure? I would think that we should...
15. "Secondly, a learner defines the specific model that models the task data or differently put learns a structure inherent in the provided data." I don't understand this sentence.
16. "library(mlr)" in the Spatial CV with mlr section looks unnecessary. We already have load this library at the beginning of the chapter.
17. "# run the following lines to find out from which package the
# learner is taken and how to access the corresponding help 
# file(s)
# getLearnerPackages(learner)
# helpLearner(learner)" - This chunk contains a lot of commented ideas. Maybe this could be added in the regular text?
18. "to run 169 learners (mlr package version: 2.13).". Maybe it is better to generalize this sentence, for example "to run more than 150 learners..".
19. "also spatially, in an inner fold (see section 13.5.2)" I suggest removing the details (", in an inner fold").
20. " Please note that package sperrorest initially implemented spatial cross-validation in R (A. Brenning 2012b). In the meantime, its functionality was integrated into the mlr package which is the reason why we are using mlr (Schratz et al. 2018).66" Is this information really important for this chapter?
21. "The caret package (...) so far it does not provide spatial CV which is why we refrain from using it for spatial data.". Maybe we could mention the CAST package in this footnote - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CAST/index.html. 
22. What was your reason to use SVM? (I my work this technique was never the one with the largest predictive quality..)
23. You state "It is beyond the scope of this book to explain exactly what a SVM is." and next there are several sentences explaining SVM. Maybe this one should be removed...
24. "Therefore, we will make sure to replace automated by spatial hyperparameter tuning in the following." I don't understand this sentence.
25. ". To find out which SVM functions are available we use again the listLearners() command." I suggest to replace this code output with a knitr table.
26. "We will use ksvm() from the kernlab package (???)." Citation is missing here.
27. What is the reason for using ksvm() instead of the different implementation of SVM>
28. What is "outer resampling loop"? This term should be either avoided or explained.
29. I am rather unsatisfied that the parallelization approach works only on Unix. Is it really impossible on Windows? For example, https://github.com/berndbischl/parallelMap states that the parallelMap package works on Windows, but only in the socket mode.
30. The **parallelMap** package is not loaded in this chapter. Therefore, the `parallelStart()` function does not work.
31. "Probably we are not the only ones using the server, therefore we are friendly and will use only half of its cores which in our case corresponds to 24 (cpus parameter)." Is it necessary to inform reader what half of the cores means in out case?
32. "saveRDS(result, "svm_sp_sp_rbf_50it.rda")" - In this comment, you save the result object to the RDS format, but with RData extension...
33. "Running 125,000 models using 24 cores took more than 37 minutes." Maybe it is better to inform (warn) readers about the runtime before the actual run? 
34. "However, using 200 instead of 50 iterations in the random search would probably yield even better hyperparameter combinations resulting in a better AUROC (Schratz et al. 2018). On the other hand, this would increase the number of models to be fitted from 125,000 to 500,000.70" What is the role of this discussion? I am afraid that it could be confusing for the readers new to ML.
35. "Here, we just have a short glance at the optimal hyperparameters combination and the result which was obtained with them in the first iteration of the outer loop." I have (probably) never used **mlr** before and I am confused here. It this the best set of hyperparameters? Or is it the best set only for one repeat of CV? How can I find and extract the best model to use it in, for example, deployment?
36. We should have acknowledgments in every (or some) chapters. There should be only one acknowledgments section for the whole book.
37. Some plots' captions in this chapter specify the CRS used. We haven't done this in the previous chapters, so it should be removed (in my opinion).
38. The chapter title - I suggest simplifying it to "Spatial machine learning". I think this shorter title is perfect, because cross-validation is the only difference between non-spatial and spatial ML.
