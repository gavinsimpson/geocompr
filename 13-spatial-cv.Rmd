# Spatial cross-validation for machine learning {#spatial-cv}

## Prerequisites {-}

This chapter requires a strong grasp of spatial data analysis and processing, covered in chapters \@ref(spatial-class) to \@ref(transform).
You should also be familiar with linear regression, its generalized extensions and machine learning [e.g. @zuur_mixed_2009;@james_introduction_2013].

The chapter uses the following packages:

```{r, message = FALSE} 
library(mlr)
library(pROC)
library(raster)
library(RSAGA)
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
```

- Required data will be downloaded in due course.

## Introduction

Section \@ref(software-for-geocomputation) mentioned several programming languages suitable for command-line based geocomputation.
The advantages of geocomputation with R were discussed, including its unparalleled statistical power.
This chapter makes use of some of this statistical power, by demonstrating methods for predictive mapping by means of statistical learning [@james_introduction_2013].
The main focus, however, is the use of spatial cross-validation (or 'spatial CV' for short, a term we will define shortly) to assess model performance and reduce spatial bias.
Spatial CV is an excellent example of using statistical methods to model spatial data and, at the time of writing, the technique is better supported in R than any other language.

Statistical learning comprises a large suite of techniques for understanding data.
Statistical learning can be roughly grouped into supervised and unsupervised techniques, both of which are used throughout a vast range of disciplines including economics, physics, medicine, biology, ecology and geography [@james_introduction_2013].
In this chapter we will focus on supervised techniques, i.e., we have a response variable, in our case this will be a binary one (landslide vs. non-landslide occurrence) but could be also a numeric (pH value), an integer (species richness) or a categorical variable (land use).
Supervised techniques model the relationship between the response variable and various predictors.
For this we can use techniques from the field of statistics or from the field of machine learning.
Which to use depends on the aim: statistical inference or prediction.
(Semi-)Parametric regression techniques are especially useful if the aim is statistical inference, i.e. if we are interested in a predictor's significance, its importance for a specific model and to explain relationships between response and predictors.
To trust the p-values and standard errors of such models we need to perform a thorough model validation testing if one or several of the underlying model assumptions (heterogeneity, independence, etc.) have been violated [@zuur_mixed_2009].
By contrast, machine learning aims at predictions and is especially appealing due its lack of assumptions.
Though statistical inference is impossible [@james_introduction_2013], various studies have shown that machine learning is at least at par with regression techniques regarding predictive performance [e.g., @schratz_performance_nodate]. <!-- add one more source -->
Naturally, with the advent of big data, machine learning has even gained in popularity since frequently the underlying relationship between variables is less important than the prediction.
Think for instance of future customer behavior or the classification of e-mails as spam.
Note that we can borrow regression techniques from statistics for machine learning when the aim is prediction.
In this case we do not have too worry too much about possible model misspecifications since we explicitly do not want to do statistical inference.
In fact, in this chapter the aim will be the (spatial) prediction of landslide susceptibility. 
We will start out with a generalized linear model (GLM) which is probably familiar to most readers^[Readers who are in need of refreshing their regression skills might have a look at @zuur_mixed_2009 and @james_introduction_2013, respectively.], before moving on to using a typical machine learning algorithm, namely a support vector machine.
Instead of explaining in detail the models we will focus on the specialty of geographic data in a modeling context and the models' predictive performance via spatial CV.

CV determines a model's ability to predict new data or differently put its ability to generalize.
To achieve this, CV splits a dataset (repeatedly) into test and training sets.
It uses the training data to fit the model, and checks if the trained model is able to predict the correct results for the test data.
Basically, cross-validation helps to detect over-fitting since a model that fits too closely the training data and its specific peculiarities (noise, random fluctuations) will have a bad prediction performance on the test data.
However, the basic requirement for this is, that the test data is independent of the training data.
CV achieves this by splitting the data randomly into test and training sets. 
However, randomly splitting spatial data results in the fact that training points are frequently located next to test points.
Since points close to each other are more similar compared to points further away, test and training datasets might not be independent.
The consequence is that cross-validation would fail to detect over-fitting in the presence of spatial autocorrelation.
Here, spatial CV will come to the rescue which will be the main topic of this chapter.

## Case study: landslide susceptibility {#case-landslide}

To introduce spatial CV by example, we will use a landslide dataset from Southern Ecuador (Figure \@ref(fig:lsl-map)).
For a detailed description of the dataset and the study area please refer to @muenchow_geomorphic_2012.
One can find a subset of the corresponding data in the **RSAGA** package.
The following command loads three datasets, a `data.frame` named `landslides`, a `list` named `dem`, and an `sf`-object named `study_area`.

```{r}
data("landslides", package = "RSAGA")
```

`landslides` contains a factor column `lslpts` where `TRUE` corresponds to an observed landslide initiation point and `FALSE` to points where no landsliding occurred. 
Columns `x` and `y` contain the corresponding coordinates.
The landslide initiation point is located in the scarp of a landslide polygon.
The coordinates for the non-landslide points were sampled randomly with the restriction to fall outside of the slightly buffered landslide polygons.
`summary(landslides$lslpts)` tells us that 175 landslide points and 1360 non-landslide points are available.
To make the ratio between landslide and non-landslide points more balanced, we randomly sample 175 from the 1360 non-landslide points.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# select non-landslide points
non = filter(landslides, lslpts == FALSE)
# select landslide points
lsl_pts = filter(landslides, lslpts == TRUE)
# randomly select 175 non-landslide points
ind = sample(1:nrow(non), nrow(lsl_pts))
# rowbind randomly selected non-landslide points and 
# landslide points
lsl = rbind(non[ind, ], lsl_pts)
```

`dem` is in fact a digital elevation model and consists of two list elements with the first being a raster header and the second being a matrix containing the altitudinal values.
To transform this list into a `raster` object, we can write:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dem = 
  raster(dem$data, 
         crs = dem$header$proj4string,
         xmn = dem$header$xllcorner, 
         xmx = dem$header$xllcorner + 
           dem$header$ncols * dem$header$cellsize,
         ymn = dem$header$yllcorner,
         ymx = dem$header$yllcorner + 
           dem$header$nrows * dem$header$cellsize)
```

To model the probability for landslide occurrence, we need some predictors.
We will use selected terrain attributes frequently associated with landsliding [@muenchow_geomorphic_2012], all of which can be computed from the provided digital elevation model (`dem`) using R-GIS bridges (see Chapter \@ref(gis)).
We leave it as an exercise to the reader to compute the terrain attribute rasters and extract the corresponding values to our landslide/non-landslide dataframe (see also exercises).
The first three rows of the resulting dataframe (still named `lsl`) excluding the coordinates could look like this:
<!-- has anybody an idea why I have to run the following code chunk two times to make it work when rendering the book with `bookdown::render_book()`?-->
```{r, echo=FALSE}
load("extdata/spatialcv.Rdata")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
load("extdata/spatialcv.Rdata")
```

```{r}
dplyr::select(lsl, -x, -y) %>%
  head(., 3)
```

The added columns are:

- `slope`: slope angle (°)
- `cplan`: plan curvature (rad m^−1^) expressing the convergence or divergence of a slope and thus water flow.
- `cprof`: profile curvature (rad m^-1^) as a measure of flow acceleration, also known as downslope change in slope angle 
- `elev`: elevation (m a.s.l.) as the representation of different altitudinal zones of vegetation and precipitation in the study area.
- `log_carea`: the decadic logarithm of the catchment area (log m^2^) representing the amount of water flowing towards a location.

```{r lsl-map, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Landslide initiation points (red) and points unaffected by landsliding (blue) in Southern Ecuador. CRS: UTM zone 17S (EPSG: 32717)."}
library(tmap)
lsl_sf = st_as_sf(lsl, coords = c("x", "y"), crs = 32717)
hs = hillShade(ta$slope * pi / 180, terrain(ta$elev, opt = "aspect"))
rect = tmaptools::bb_poly(hs)
bbx = tmaptools::bb(hs, xlim = c(-0.02, 1), ylim = c(-0.02, 1), relative = TRUE)
# randomly sample 20%
# ind = sample(1:nrow(lsl_sf), round(nrow(lsl_sf) * 0.2))
# sam = lsl_sf[ind, ]

tm_shape(hs, bbox = bbx) +
	tm_grid(col = "black", n.x = 1, n.y = 1, labels.inside.frame = FALSE,
	        labels.rot = c(0, 90)) +
	tm_raster(palette = gray(0:100 / 100), n = 100, legend.show = FALSE) +
	tm_shape(ta$elev) +
	tm_raster(alpha = 0.5, palette = terrain.colors(10),
	          auto.palette.mapping = FALSE, legend.show = FALSE) +
	tm_shape(lsl_sf) + 
	tm_bubbles("lslpts", size = 0.5, palette = "-RdYlBu") +
#   tm_shape(sam) +
#   tm_bubbles(border.col = "gold", border.lwd = 2, alpha = 0, size = 0.5) +
  qtm(rect, fill = NULL) +
	tm_layout(outer.margins = c(0.04, 0.04, 0.02, 0.02), frame = FALSE)
```


## Conventional modeling approach in R {#conventional-model}
Later on we will introduce the **mlr** package, an umbrella-package providing a unified interface to hundreds of modeling approaches. 
Before doing so, it is worth taking a look at the conventional modeling interface in R.
This way we introduce statistical supervised modeling in R which provides the required skill set for doing spatial CV and additionally contributes to a better grasp on the **mlr** approach introduced later on.
Usually, we model the response variable as a function of predictors. 
Therefore, modeling functions in R such as `lm`, `glm` and many more use the so-called formula interface.
Let's put this into practice by modeling the landslide occurrence as a function of terrain attributes.
Since our response (landslide occurrence) belongs to the binary category, we use a binomial generalized linear model instead of a simple linear model which would expect a normally distributed numeric response variable.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
fit = glm(lslpts ~ slope + cplan + cprof + elev + log_carea, 
          data = lsl, family = binomial())
# the same as:
# fit = glm(lslpts ~ ., data = select(lsl, -x, -y))
fit
```

Subsequently, we can use the estimated model coefficients for predictions.
The generic `predict()` function does this automatically for us.
The `response` option gives back the predicted probabilities (of landslide occurrence) for each observation in `lsl` (see `?predict.glm`).


```{r}
head(predict(object = fit, type = "response"))
```

We can also predict spatially by applying the coefficients to our predictor rasters. 
We could do this manually but can also use **raster**'s `predict()` function.
This function also expects the fitted model as input as well as a raster stack with the predictors exactly named as in the fitted model (Figure \@ref(fig:lsl-susc)).

```{r}
pred = raster::predict(object = ta, model = fit,
                       type = "response")
```

```{r lsl-susc, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Spatial prediction of landslide susceptibility using a  GLM. CRS: UTM zone 17S (EPSG: 32717).", warning=FALSE}
# white raster to only plot the axis ticks, otherwise gridlines would be visible
tm_shape(hs, bbox = bbx) +
  tm_grid(col = "black", n.x = 1, n.y = 1, labels.inside.frame = FALSE,
          labels.rot = c(0, 90)) +
  tm_raster(palette = "white", legend.show = FALSE) +
  # hillshade
  tm_shape(mask(hs, study_area), bbox = bbx) +
	tm_raster(palette = gray(0:100 / 100), n = 100, legend.show = FALSE) +
	# prediction raster
  tm_shape(mask(pred, study_area)) +
	tm_raster(alpha = 0.5, palette = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(name = "Reds", 6),
	          auto.palette.mapping = FALSE, legend.show = TRUE,
	          title = "Susceptibility\nprobability") +
	# rectangle and outer margins
  qtm(rect, fill = NULL) +
	tm_layout(outer.margins = c(0.04, 0.04, 0.02, 0.02), frame = FALSE,
	          legend.position = c("left", "bottom"),
	          legend.title.size = 0.9)

```

Here, when making predictions we neglect spatial autocorrelation since we assume that on average predictive accuracies of parametric models remain the same with or without spatial autocorrelation structures.
However, it is possible to include spatial autocorrelation structures into models as well as into the predictions.
This is, however, beyond the scope of this book.
Nevertheless, we give the interested reader some pointers where to look it up.
There are three main directions:

1. The predictions of universal kriging are the predictions of a simple linear model plus the kriged model's residuals, i.e. spatially interpolated residuals [@bivand_applied_2013]. 
1. Adding a spatial correlation (dependency) structure to a generalized least squares model  [`nlme::gls()`; @zuur_mixed_2009; @zuur_beginners_2017].  ^[These correlation structures can also be included in `MASS::glmmPQL()` and `mgcv::gamm()`.]
1. Finally, there are mixed-effect modeling approaches.
Basically, a random effect imposes a dependency structure on the response variable which in turn allows for observations of one class to be more similar to each other than to those of another class [@zuur_mixed_2009]. 
Classes can be for example bee hives, owl nests, vegetation transects or an altitudinal stratification.
This mixed modeling approach assumes normal and independent distributed random intercepts.^[Note that for spatial predictions one would usually use the population intercept.]
This can even be extended by using a random intercept that is normal and spatially dependent.
For this, however, you will have to resort most likely to Bayesian modeling approaches since frequentist software tools are rather limited in this respect especially for more complex models [@blangiardo_spatial_2015; @zuur_beginners_2017]. 

Spatial predictions are one very important outcome of a model.
Even more important is how good the model is at making them since the most beautiful prediction map is useless if a model's predictive performance is bad.
The most popular measure to assess the predictive performance of a binomial model is the Area Under the Receiver Operator Characteristic Curve (AUROC).
This is a value between 0.5 and 1.0 with 0.5 indicating no and 1.0 indicating a perfect discrimination of the two classes. 
Thus, the higher the AUROC the better is our model at making predictions.
In the following we compute the receiver operator characteristic with the help of `roc()` by providing it with the response variable and the predicted values. 
`auc()` returns the area under the curve.

```{r, message=FALSE}
pROC::auc(pROC::roc(lsl$lslpts, fitted(fit)))
```

An AUROC of `r round(pROC::auc(pROC::roc(lsl$lslpts, fitted(fit))), 2)` represents a good fit.
However, this is an overoptimistic estimation since we have computed it on the complete dataset. 
To derive an biased-reduced assessment we have to use cross-validation and in the case of spatial data we will have to make use of spatial CV.

## Introduction to (spatial) cross-validation {#intro-cv} 

Cross-validation belongs to the family of resampling methods [@james_introduction_2013].
The basic idea is to split (repeatedly) a dataset into training and test sets whereby the training data is used to fit a model which then is applied to the test set.
Comparing the predicted values with the known response values from the test set (using a performance measure such as the AUROC in the binomial case) gives a bias-reduced assessment of the model's capability to generalize the learned relationship to independent data.
For example, a 100-repeated 5-fold cross-validation means to randomly split the data into five partitions (folds) with each fold being used once as a test set (see upper row of Figure \@ref(fig:partitioning)). 
This guarantees that each observation is used once as the test set, and requires the fitting of five models.
Subsequently, this procedure is repeated 100 times.
Of course, the data splitting will differ (though often only slightly) in each repetition.
Overall, this amounts to fitting 500 models whereas the mean performance measure (AUROC) of all models is the model's overall prediction power.

However, geographic data is special.
Remember that the first law of geography states that points close to each other tend to be, on average, more similar compared to points further away (@miller_toblers_2004; Chapter \@ref(transport)).
This means these points are not statistically independent or put differently that training and test points in conventional cross-validation are often too close to each other (see first row of \@ref(fig:partitioning)).
Using this information in our modeling is like a sneak preview, i.e. using information that should be unavailable to the training dataset.
To overcome this problem, we should make use of spatial partitioning which splits the observations into spatially disjoint folds (using the observations' coordinates in a *k*-means clustering; @brenning_spatial_2012; second row of Figure \@ref(fig:partitioning)).
The partitioning strategy is **the** distinguishing feature between spatial and conventional cross-validation.
Everything else remains exactly the same.
As a result spatial CV leads to a bias-reduced assessment of a model's predictive performance, and hence helps to avoid over-fitting.
It is important to note that spatial CV reduces the bias introduced by spatial autocorrelation but does not completely remove it. 
This is because there are still a few points in the test and training data which are still neighbors (@brenning_spatial_2012; see second row of \@ref(fig:partitioning)).

```{r partitioning, fig.cap="Spatial visualization of selected test and training observations for cross-validation in one repetition. Random (upper row) and spatial partitioning (lower row).", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/13_partitioning.png")
```

## Spatial CV with **mlr**
In R there are literally hundreds of packages available for statistical learning (e.g., have a look at the [CRAN task machine learning](https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=MachineLearning)).
In section \@ref(conventional-model) we used the **stats** package to fit a logistic regression using the `glm()` command.
`glm()` uses the common R modeling interface: 

1. specify the response and predictor variables via a formula object
2. build a model
3. make a prediction.

However, many packages come with their own or a modified statistical learning interface which is why users frequently have to spend a lot of time to figure out the specifics of each of these packages, how to carry out cross-valdiation and hyperparameter tuning or how to compare modeling results from different packages.
The **mlr** package acts as a meta- or umbrella-package providing a unified interface to the most popular statistical learning techniques available in R including classification, regression, survival analysis and clustering [@bischl_mlr:_2016].^[As pointed out in the beginning we will solely focus on supervised learning techniques in this chapter.]
The standardized **mlr** interface is based on so-called basic building blocks (Figure \@ref(fig:building-blocks)).

<!-- @Jakub: yes, I will ask if we me may use the figure -->
```{r building-blocks, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=4, fig.cap="Basic building blocks of the **mlr** package. Source: [openml.github.io](http://openml.github.io/articles/slides/useR2017_tutorial/slides_tutorial_files/ml_abstraction-crop.png)."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/13_ml_abstraction_crop.png")
```

First, we need to create a **task** containing the data, specifically the response and predictor variables, for the model and the model type (such as regression or classification).
Secondly, a **learner** defines the specific model that models the task data or differently put learns a structure inherent in the provided data.
Thirdly, we assess the predictive performance of the model, i.e. the model's ability to generalize the learned relationship to new data via a repetitive **resampling** approach (see also section \@ref(intro-cv)).

To put this into practice, we create a **task** using our landslide data.
Since we have a binary response, which is in fact a two-category variable, we will make use of the classification task, namely `makeClassifTask()`.^[In the case of a regression problem, we would use `makeRegrTask()`.
Type `?makeClassifTask` to find out about all available modeling tasks.
]
First, we specify the data which will be used.
The `target` parameter expects the response variable and the `positive` parameter determines which of the two factor levels of the response variable indicate the landslide initiation point.
All other variables of the provided dataset will serve as predictors (check out with `getTaskFormula(task)`).
As we will perform a spatial CV later on, we need to specify the coordinates which will form the basis of the spatial partitioning (see section \@ref(intro-cv) and Figure \@ref(fig:partitioning)).
These have to be provided as a dataframe in parameter `coordinates`. 

```{r}
library(mlr)
# separate data to be modeled and coordinates
coords = lsl[, c("x", "y")]
data = dplyr::select(lsl, -x, -y)
# create task
task = makeClassifTask(data = data, target = "lslpts",
                       positive = "TRUE", coordinates = coords)
```

`makeLearner()` determines the statistical learning method to use.
All classification **learners** start with `classif.` and all regression learners with `regr.` (see `?makeLearners` for more details). 
`listLearners()` helps to find out about all available learners and from which package **mlr** imports them. 
For a specific task, we can run:

<!-- no idea, why render_book() fails frequently because function listLearners() cannot be found...:
I also have this issue (RL - so not running and hardcoding result)-->

```{r, eval=FALSE}
lrns = mlr::listLearners(task)
dplyr::select(lrns, class, name, package) %>%
  head
#>                 class                         name package
#> 1    classif.binomial          Binomial Regression   stats
#> 2 classif.featureless       Featureless classifier     mlr
#> 3         classif.fnn     Fast k-Nearest Neighbour     FNN
#> 4         classif.knn           k-Nearest Neighbor   class
#> 5         classif.lda Linear Discriminant Analysis    MASS
#> 6      classif.logreg          Logistic Regression   stats
```

This yields all learners able to model two-class problems (landslide yes or no).
We opt for the binomial classification method from the **stats** package which we already have used in section \@ref(conventional-model) and is implemented as `classif.binomial` in **mlr**.
Additionally, we have to specify the link-function.
We choose the `logit` link which is also the default when using the `binomial` family in `glm` (run `binomial()` to verify).
`predict.type` determines the type of the prediction with
<!-- Setting it to `response` produces class labels as output, which would be in our case `TRUE` or `FALSE`. -->
 `prob` resulting in a predicted probability for landslide occurrence between 0 and 1.^[Note that this corresponds to `type = response` in `predict.glm`.]

```{r}
lrn = makeLearner(cl = "classif.binomial",
                  link = "logit",
                  predict.type = "prob",
                  fix.factors.prediction = TRUE)
# run the following lines to find out from which package the
# learner is taken and how to access the corresponding help 
# file(s)
# getLearnerPackages(learner)
# helpLearner(learner)
```

<!--
Having specified a learner and a task, we can train our model which basically executes the `glm()` command in the background for our task. 

```{r}
mod = train(learner = lrn, task = task)
mlr_fit = getLearnerModel(mod)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
getTaskFormula(task)
getTaskData(task)
getLearnerModel(mod)
mod$learner.model
```

`getLearnerModel()` extracts the used model which shows that **mlr** passed all specified parameters to the `glm` function in the background as also proved by following code:

```{r}
fit = glm(lslpts ~ ., family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = data)
identical(fit$coefficients, mlr_fit$coefficients)
```
-->

In the beginning, it might seem a bit tedious to learn the **mlr** interface for modeling.
But remember that one only has to learn one single interface to run many learners (**mlr** package version: `r packageVersion("mlr")`).
Additionally, (spatial) resampling in **mlr** is really easy and only requires two more steps.^[Further advantages are the easy parallelization of resampling techniques and the tuning of machine learning hyperparameters, also spatially, in an inner fold.]
Please note that package **sperrorest** initially implemented spatial cross-validation in R [@brenning_spatial_2012].
In the meantime, its functionality was integrated into the **mlr** package which is the reason why we are using **mlr**.^[The **caret** package is another umbrella-package [@kuhn_applied_2013] for streamlined modeling in R, however, so far it does not provide spatial CV which is why we refrain from using it for spatial data.]
The first thing to do is specifying a resampling method.
We will use a 100-repeated 5-fold spatial CV.
This ensures that a spatial partitioning with five partitions is chosen based on the provided coordinates in our `task` and that the partitioning is repeated 100 times.

```{r}
resampling = makeResampleDesc(method = "SpRepCV", folds = 5, 
                              reps = 100)
```

To execute the spatial resampling, we run `resample()` using the specified learner, task, resampling strategy and of course the performance measure, here the AUROC.
This takes a short while because we ask R to compute the AUROC from 500 models. 


```{r, eval=FALSE}
set.seed(012348)
sp_cv = mlr::resample(learner = lrn, task = task,
                      resampling = resampling, 
                      measures = mlr::auc)
```

<!-- sp_cv and conv_cv have been saved in spatialcv.Rdata. I needed to run the modeling outside of the book since knitr sets its own seed and I am not sure if this actually helps to make sure that the same partitions are used in the cv.
I really don't understand why I have to load spatialcv.Rdata here a third time...-->

```{r, echo=FALSE}
load("extdata/spatialcv.Rdata")
```

The output is a bias-reduced assessment of the model's predictive performance. 

```{r}
# summary statistics of the 500 models
summary(sp_cv$measures.test$auc)
# mean AUROC of the 500 models
mean(sp_cv$measures.test$auc)
```

To put it into perspective, we compare this result with that of a 100-repeated 5-fold non-spatial cross-validation (Figure \@ref(fig:boxplot-cv); the code for the non-spatial cross-validation is not shown here but will be explored in the exercise section).
As expected, the spatially cross-validated result yields lower AUROC values on average than the conventional cross-validation approach, underlining the over-optimistic predictive performance due to spatial autocorrelation of the latter.

        conv_cv$measures.test$auc,
        col = c("lightblue2", "mistyrose2"),

        ylab = "AUROC")
```

## (Spatial) Tuning of machine-learning hyperparameters
<!-- exercise: assess predictive performance without using an inner fold -->
In the beginning we have already distinguished the field of statistics from the field of machine learning.
As a reminder we define machine learning here again with the words of [Jason Brownlee](https://machinelearningmastery.com/linear-regression-for-machine-learning/):

> Machine learning, more specifically the field of predictive modeling is primarily concerned with minimizing the error of a model or making the most accurate predictions possible, at the expense of explainability. In applied machine learning we will borrow, reuse and steal algorithms from many different fields, including statistics and use them towards these ends.

In the previous section we have used a GLM for predicting landslide susceptibility, in this section we will introduce the support vector machine (SVM) for the same purpose.


This means that parametric models such as (generalized) linear regression are also used in the field of machine learning when the aim is prediction.

Machine-learning differs from parametric models in that 
difference parameters and hyperparameters
example: support vector machine and short intro what it is
best practice: inner fold -> Patrick figure
parallelization (conclusion -> server/remote modeling + mc.core.seed)


> Model selection without nested CV uses the same data to tune model parameters and evaluate model performance. Information may thus “leak” into the model and overfit the data. The magnitude of this effect is primarily dependent on the size of the dataset and the stability of the model.

SVM

> The idea of finding a hyperplane that separates the data as well as possible, while allowing some violations to this separation, seemed distinctly different from classical approaches for classification, such as logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis. Moreover, the idea of using a kernel to expand the feature space in order to accommodate non-linear class boundaries appeared to be a unique and valuable characteristic.

James et al., 2013
Support vector machines always require tuning to find the optimal hyperparameters.
Some software packages/implementations come with an automated tuning.
which is usually based on random sampling.
This is useful in the case of non-spatial data but of less use in the case of spatial data where spatial tuning should be preferred.
Therefore, we will make sure to replace automated by spatial hyperparameter tuning.
Without going into too much detail SVM 


Setting up the **mlr** building blocks follows the exact same procedure introduced in the previous section, i.e. we define a task, a learner and a resampling strategy.
The task remains the same, hence we can use the one already defined in the previous section, namely `task`.
However, we have to define a new learner since we are going to use a SVM.
So let us find out which SVM functions are available in the **mlr** package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
lrns = mlr::listLearners(task)
lrns[grep("svm", lrns$class), ]
dplyr::select(lrns, class, name, package) 
#>            class                                 name short.name package
#> 6   classif.ksvm              Support Vector Machines       ksvm kernlab
#> 9  classif.lssvm Least Squares Support Vector Machine      lssvm kernlab
#> 17   classif.svm     Support Vector Machines (libsvm)        svm   e1071
```

We will use `ksvm()` from the kernlab package.
To allow for non-linearity we use the radial basis function (or Gaussian) kernel which is also the default of `ksvm()` and probably the most popular SVM kernel in general.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
lrn_ksvm = makeLearner("classif.ksvm",
                        predict.type = "prob",
                        kernel = "rbfdot")
```

Hence, the only thing left to do is to specify a resampling strategy.
Again we will use a 100-repeated 5-fold spatial CV.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# outer resampling loop
outer = makeResampleDesc("SpRepCV", folds = 5, reps = 100)
```

However, we need to additionally tune the SVM hyperparameters.
Using the same data for the performance assessment and for the tuning would potentially lead to overoptimistic results [@cawley_on_2010].
To avoid this we will use a nested spatial CV.

```{r inner-outer, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Visual representation of inner and outer folds in spatial and non-spatial cross-validation. Permission for reproducing the figure was kindly provided by Patrick Schratz [@schratz_performance_nodate]"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/13_cv.png")
```

This means that we split each fold again into five spatially disjoint subfolds which are used to determine the optimal hyperparameters (`inner` object in the code chunk below; see Figure \@ref(fig:inner-outer) for a visual representation).
To find the optimal hyperparameter combination we would like to fit 50 models in each of these subfolds with randomly selected hyperparameter values (`ctrl` object in the code chunk below).
Additionally, we restrict the randomly chosen values to a predefined tuning space (`ps` object).
The latter was chosen with values recommended in the literature [@schratz_performance_nodate].

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# five spatially disjoint partitions
inner = makeResampleDesc("SpCV", iters = 5)
# use 50 randomly selected hyperparameters
ctrl = makeTuneControlRandom(maxit = 50)
# define the outer limits of the randomly selected hyperparameters
ps = makeParamSet(
  makeNumericParam("C", lower = -12, upper = 15, trafo = function(x) 2^x),
  makeNumericParam("sigma", lower = -15, upper = 6, trafo = function(x) 2^x)
  )
```

Finally, we add all the parameters defining the inner hyperparameter loop to our learner `lrn_ksvm` through a wrapper function.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
wrapped_lrn_ksvm = makeTuneWrapper(learner = lrn_ksvm, 
                                   resampling = inner,
                                   par.set = ps,
                                   control = ctrl, 
                                   show.info = TRUE,
                                   measures = mlr::auc)
```

Overall, this set up implies that we ask R to fit 250 models to determine the optimal hyperparameters which are then used for the performance assessment in the first fold of the outer resampling loop.
We have to repeat this five times for each fold in the outer fold which leads to 250 * 5 models for one repetition in the outer loop.
Since we are requesting 100 repetitions this leads to a total of 125,000 models. 
This is computationally quite demanding even with the small dataset used here.
So before starting the actual resampling it would be wise to reduce runtime with the help of a parallelization approach. 
In general, multicore processing is easier on Linux than Windows systems.
In fact, cloud computing is usually done and developed on Linux servers.
Therefore, we will present how to do nested cross-validatation using a parallelization approach working only under Linux.^[Note also that the `mc.set.seeds` parameter used later on is only available for Linux machines].
Windows users have at least two options:

1. Run the code without inializing the parallelization though this might take a while.
2. Install a virtual machine (e.g. [Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)) to reproduce the subsequent code.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
configureMlr(on.learner.error = "warn", on.error.dump = TRUE)
# check the number of cores
n = parallel::detectCores()
# parallelize the tuning, i.e. the inner fold
parallelStart(mode = "multicore", level = "mlr.tuneParams", 
              cpus = round(n / 2),
              mc.set.seed = TRUE) 

set.seed(12345)
resa_svm_spatial = mlr::resample(wrapper_ksvm, task,
                                 resampling = outer, extract = getTuneResult,
                                 show.info = TRUE, measures = mlr::auc)

# Aggregated Result: auc.test.mean=0.7583375
parallelStop()
# save your result
# saveRDS(resa_svm_spatial, "extdata/svm_sp_sp_rbf_50it.rda")

# Exploring the results

# 5 models
resa_svm_spatial$extract[[1]]
# and here one can observe that the AUC of the tuning data is usually higher
# than for the model on the outer fold

## Conclusions
Resampling methods are a crucial part of a modern data scientist's toolbox [@james_introduction_2013]. 
In this chapter we used cross-validation to assess a model's predictive performance.
Spatial data is statistically often not independent due to spatial autocorrelation, which violates a fundamental assumption of cross-validation.
Therefore, we introduced spatial CV, which reduces the bias introduced by spatial autocorrelation. 
The **mlr** package makes it easy to use (spatial) resampling techniques with many other statistical learning techniques including, of course, linear regression, but also semi-parametric models (e.g., generalized additive models) and machine learning techniques such as random forests, support vector machines or boosted regression trees [@bischl_mlr:_2016;@schratz_performance_nodate].
Machine learning algorithms often require the tuning of so-called hyperparameters.
This should be done using a nested (spatial) cross-validation approach [@schratz_performance_nodate], a topic we will explore in more detail in Chapter \@ref(eco).
As a preview, this requires the fitting of tens of thousands of additional models, and is therefore computationally more demanding.
Naturally, computation time additionally increases with the size of the input data.
To reduce computing time, **mlr** makes parallelization easy through various supported methods (see Chapter \@ref(eco)).

## Exercises

1. Compute the terrain attributes slope, plan curvature, profile curvature and catchment area from `dem` (provided by `data("landslides", package = "RSAGA")`) with the help of R-GIS bridges (see Chapter \@ref(gis)), and extract the values from the corresponding output rasters to the `landslides` dataframe (`data(landslides, package = "RSAGA"`)).
Keep all landslide initation points and 175 randomly selected non-landslide points (see section \@ref(case-landslide)).
1. Use the derived terrain attributs rasters in combination with a GLM to make a spatial prediction map similar to Figure \@ref(fig:lsl-susc).
1. Compute a 100-repeated 5-fold non-spatial cross-validation and spatial CV based on the GLM learner and compare the AUROC values from both resampling strategies with the help of boxplots (see Figure \@ref(fig:boxplot-cv)).
Hint: You need to specify a non-spatial task and a non-spatial resampling strategy.
Before running the spatial cross-validation for both tasks set a seed to make sure that both use the same partitions which in turn guarantees comparability.
1. Model landslide susceptibility using a quadratic discriminant analysis [QDA, @james_introduction_2013].
Assess the predictive performance (AUROC) of the QDA. 
What is the a difference between the spatially cross-validated mean AUROC value of the QDA and the GLM?
Hint: Before running the spatial cross-validation for both learners set a seed to make sure that both use the same partitions which in turn guarantees comparability.

<!--
hyperparameter tuning:
The training data is again partitioned into 5 folds but only once.
Now each fold is used once as a test set, and the remaining training data is used to find the optimal hyperparameter tuning via a random search with 50 (or whatever number) iterations -> 250 iterations to find the optimal hyperparameter combination. 
This combination serves as input for the model in the outer level.

Hyperparameters are always tuned in mlr in an inner loop (I suppose). 
But why do we need the inner tuning.
Well, otherwise we would tune our hyperparameters on the test set of the outer loop, and this is like taking a sneak preview.
