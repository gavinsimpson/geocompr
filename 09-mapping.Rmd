## Introduction

A satisfying and important aspect of geographic research is producing and communicating the results in the form of maps.
Map making --- the art of Cartography --- is an ancient skill that involves precision, consideration of the map-reader and often an element of creativity.
Basic plotting of geographic data is straightforward in R with `plot()` (see section \@ref(basic-map)) which already allows the fabrication of quality maps.
Advanced map-making even increases this quality and is a skill worth learning, since:
a carefully crafted map can communicate results effectively and avoid time spent generating them going to waste due to poor presentation [@brewer_designing_2015]:

> Amateur-looking maps can undermine your audienceâ€™s ability to understand important information and weaken the presentation of a professional data investigation.

<!-- Todo: consider adding footnote saying it's good to focus on visualization early as in R4DS but that we cover it later because there's a risk of getting distracted by pretty pictures to the detriment of good analysis. -->

Maps have been used for several thousand years for a wide variety of purposes.
Historic examples include maps on buildings in Babylon and Ptolemy's world map in his masterpiece *Geography*.
However, maps have historically been out of reach for everyday people [@talbert_ancient_2014].
Modern computing has the potential to change this.
Map making skills can also help meet research and public engagement objectives.
From a research perspective clear maps are often be the best way to present the results of geocomputational research.
From policy and 'citizen science' perspectives, attractive and engaging maps can help change peoples' minds, based on the evidence.
Map making is therefore a critical part of geocomputation and its emphasis is not only describing, but also changing the world (see Chapter \@ref(intro)).

<!-- info about relation between efficiency and editability -->
<!-- intro to the chapter structure -->

## Static maps

Static maps are the most common type of visual output from geocomputation.
They are fixed images that can be included in printed outputs or published online.
The majority of maps contained in this book, for example, are static maps saved as `.png` files (interactive maps are covered in section \@ref(interactive-maps)).

The generic `plot()` function is often the fastest way to create static maps from vector and raster spatial objects, as demonstrated in sections \@ref(basic-map) and \@ref(basic-map-raster).
Sometimes the simplicity and speed of this approach is sufficient, especially during the development phase of a project:
when using R interactively to understand a geographic dataset, you will likely be the only person who sees them.
The base R approach is also extensible, as illustrated in Chapter [14](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/RG2e/chapter14.html) of *R Graphics* [@murrell_r_2016], allowing detailed control over graphical parameters provided by `plot()` and the **grid** package.
<!-- well, base R plotting and the grid package already allow for the making of high-quality maps suitable for publication. So the advantage of tmap is to do the same in with less and concise code? In any case, it would be good to emphasize the advantage the specific advantage of tmap compared to base plotting + grid. It would be also worth noting why tmap is the better option than ggplot2. Allows a wide variety of spatial formats -->
The focus of this section, however, is map making publication-quality and engaging maps using minimal time and code with dedicated packages, particularly **tmap**.

Robin: tmap allows a wide variety of spatial formats especially raster objects (probably will also support stars?) -->

Why **tmap**?
It is a powerful and flexible map-making package with sensible defaults.
It has a concise syntax that will be familiar to **ggplot2** users and has a unique capability to generate static and interactive maps using the same code via `tmap_mode()`.
**tmap** is well documented in the vignettes [`tmap-nutshell`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-nutshell.html) and [`tmap-modes`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-modes.html).
This section teaches how to make static maps with **tmap**, emphasizing the important aesthetic and layout options.

### tmap basics

**tmap** generates maps with sensible defaults for a wide range of spatial objects with `tm_shape()` (which accepts raster and vector objects), followed by one or more layer elements such as `tm_fill()` and `tm_dots()`.
These functions are used singularly and in combination in the code chunk below, which generates the maps presented in Figure \@ref(fig:tmshape):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Add fill layer to nz shape
tm_shape(nz) + tm_fill() 
# Add border layer to nz shape
tm_shape(nz) + tm_borders() 
# Add fill and border layers to nz shape
tm_shape(nz) + tm_fill() + tm_borders() 
```

<!--
```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(st_union(st_geometry(nz)), col = "lightgray")
box()
plot(st_geometry(nz), col = "white")
box()
plot(st_geometry(nz), col = "lightgray")
box()
```
-->

```{r tmshape, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="New Zealand's shape plotted with fill (left), border (middle) and fill *and* border (right) layers added using **tmap** functions."}
source("code/09-tmshape.R")
```

The object passed to `tm_shape()` in this case is `nz`, which represents the regions of New Zealand.
Layers are added to represent `nz` visually, with `tm_fill()` and `tm_borders()` creating shaded areas (right panel) and border outlines (middle panel) in Figure \@ref(fig:tmshape), respectively.

This is an intuitive approach to map making:
the common task of *adding* new layers is undertaken by the addition operator `+`, followed by `tm_*()`.
The asterix (\*) refers to a wide range of layer types which have self-explanatory names including `fill`, `borders` (demonstrated above), `bubbles`, `text` and `raster`  (see ``?`tmap-element``` for a list of available elements).
This 'layering' is illustrated in the right panel of Figure \@ref(fig:tmshape), which shows the result of adding a border *on top of* the fill layer.
The order in which layers are added is the order in which they are rendered.

```{block2 qtm, type = 'rmdnote'}
`qtm()` is a handy function for **q**uickly creating **t**map **m**aps (hence the snappy name).
It is concise and provides a good default visualization in many cases:
`qtm(nz)`, for example, is equivalent to `tm_shape(nz) + tm_fill() + tm_borders()`.
Further, layers can be added concisely using multiple `qtm()` calls, such as `qtm(nz) + qtm(nz_height)`.
The disadvantage is that it makes aesthetics of individual layers harder to control, explaining why we avoid teaching it in this chapter.
```

### Map objects, shapes and layers

A useful feature of **tmap** is its ability to store *objects* representing maps.
The code chunk below demonstrates this by saving the last plot in Figure \@ref(fig:tmshape) as an object of class `tmap` (note the use of `tm_polygons()` which condenses `tm_fill()  + tm_borders()` into a single function):

```{r}
map_nz = tm_shape(nz) + tm_polygons()
class(map_nz)
```

`map_nz` can be plotted later, for example by adding additional layers (as shown below) or simply running `map_nz` in the console, which is equivalent to `print(map_nz)`.

New *shapes* can be added with `+ tm_shape(new_obj)`.
In this case `new_obj` represents a new spatial object to be plotted on top of preceding layers.
When a new new shape is added in this way all subsequent aesthetic functions refer to it, until another new shape is added.
This syntax allows the creation of maps with multiple shapes and layers:

```{r, results='hide'}
map_nz1 = map_nz +
  tm_shape(nz_height) + tm_bubbles()
```

Building on the previously created `map_nz` object the preceding code creates a new map object `map_nz1` which contains another shape (`nz_height`), representing high points (see Figure \@ref(fig:tmlayers), left).
<!-- tm_bubbles explanation is missing -->
More shapes and layers can be added, as illustrated in the code chunk below which creates `nz_water`, representing New Zealand's [territorial waters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_waters), and adds the resulting lines to an existing map object.

```{r}
nz_water = st_union(nz) %>% st_buffer(22200) %>%
  st_cast(to = "LINESTRING")
map_nz2 = map_nz1 +
  tm_shape(nz_water) + tm_lines()
```

There is no limit to the number of layers or shapes.
The same shape can even be used multiple times, as demonstrated by `map_nz3`.
This map is created by adding another instance of the `nz_height` shape onto the previously created `map_nz2` object, as illustrated in the right-hand panel of Figure \@ref(fig:tmlayers):

```{r}
map_nz3 = map_nz2 +
  tm_shape(nz_height) + tm_dots()
```

A useful and little known feature of **tmap** is that multiple map objects can be arranged in a single 'metaplot' with `tmap_arrange()`.
This is demonstrated in the code chunk below which plots `map_nz1` to `map_nz3`, resulting in Figure \@ref(fig:tmlayers).

```{r tmlayers, fig.cap="Maps with additional layers added to the final map of Figure 9.1."}
tmap_arrange(map_nz1, map_nz2, map_nz3)
```

Additional elements such as north arrows (`tm_compass()`), scale bars (`tm_scale_bar()`) and layout options (`tm_layout()`) can also be added with the `+` operator.
Aesthetic settings, however, are controlled by arguments to layer functions.

### Aesthetics

The plots in the previous section demonstrate **tmap**'s default aesthetic settings.
Grey shades are used for `tm_fill()` and  `tm_bubbles()` layers and a continuous red line is used to represent lines created with `tm_lines()`.
Of course, the user is provided with a fine-grained control over these default values, and other aesthetics.

There are two main types of map aesthetics: those that change with the data and those that are constant.
Unlike **ggplot2** which uses the helper function `aes()` to represent the former, **tmap** layer functions accept aesthetic arguments that are either constant values *or* variable fields.
The most commonly used aesthetics for fill and border layers include color, transparency, line width and line type, (set with `col`, `alpha`, `lwd`, and `lty` arguments respectively).
The impact of setting these with fixed values is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:tmstatic).

```{r tmstatic, fig.cap="The impact of changing commonly used fill and border aesthetics to fixed values."}
ma1 = tm_shape(nz) + tm_fill(col = "red")
ma2 = tm_shape(nz) + tm_fill(col = "red", alpha = 0.3)
ma3 = tm_shape(nz) + tm_borders(col = "blue")
ma4 = tm_shape(nz) + tm_borders(lwd = 3)
ma5 = tm_shape(nz) + tm_borders(lty = 2)
ma6 = tm_shape(nz) + tm_fill(col = "red", alpha = 0.3) +
  tm_borders(col = "blue", lwd = 3, lty = 2)
tmap_arrange(ma1, ma2, ma3, ma4, ma5, ma6)
```

Like base R plots, arguments defining aesthetics can also receive values that vary.
Unlike the base R code below (which generates the left panel in Figure \@ref(fig:tmcol)), **tmap** aesthetic arguments will not accept a numeric vector:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(st_geometry(nz), col = 1:nrow(nz))      # works
tm_shape(nz) + tm_fill(col = 1:nrow(nz)) # fails:
#> Error: Fill argument neither colors nor valid variable name(s)
```

Instead `col` (and other aesthetics that can vary such as `lwd` for line layers and `size` for point layers) requires a character string naming an attribute associated with the geometry to be plotted.
Thus, one would achieve the desired (plotted in the right-hand panel of Figure \@ref(fig:tmcol)) result as follows:^[
<!-- wouldn't say sensible, since here it appears as if tmap simply uses equal class sizes...-->
Figure \@ref(fig:tmcol) also demonstrates another benefit of **tmap**:
it automatically converts numeric variables into sensible, graduated bins.
]

```{r, fig.show='hide'}
nz$col = 1:nrow(nz)
tm_shape(nz) + tm_fill(col = "col")
```

```{r tmcol, fig.cap="Comparison of base (left) and tmap (right) handling of a numeric color field.", echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.show='hold'}
plot(nz["col"])    
tm_shape(nz) + tm_fill(col = "col")
```

An important argument in functions defining aesthetic layers such as `tm_fill()` is `title`, which sets the title of the associated legend.
The following code chunk demonstrates this functionality by providing a more attractive name than the variable name `Land_area` (note the use of `expression()` for to create superscript text):

```{r}
legend_title = expression("Area (km"^2*")")
map_nza = tm_shape(nz) +
  tm_fill(col = "Land_area", title = legend_title) + tm_borders()
```

The resulting `tmap` object `map_nza` will be used, alongside `map_nz`, to illustrate different layout settings in the next section.

### Map colors and categories
<!-- title to be improved -->

Additional aesthetic settings are demonstrated in the code chunk below, which colors regions in New Zealand depending on their area.
The results show how custom breaks can be set with the `breaks` argument (Figure \@ref(fig:tmpal) center).
Additional palette options include `n` (which sets the number of bins into which numeric variables are categorized) and `palette` (which defines the color scheme).
Results of changing values for these simultaneously are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:tmpal) (right):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
breaks = c(0, 3, 4, 5) * 10000
tm_shape(nz) + tm_fill(col = "Median_income")
tm_shape(nz) + tm_fill(col = "Median_income", breaks = breaks)
tm_shape(nz) + tm_fill(col = "Median_income", n = 10)
tm_shape(nz) + tm_fill(col = "Median_income", palette = "RdBu")
```

```{r tmpal, fig.cap="Illustration of settings that affect variable aesthetics. The result shows a continuous variable (the area in square kilometers of regions in New Zealand) converted to color with (from left to right): default settings, manual breaks, n breaks, and an alternative palette.", echo=FALSE}
source("code/09-tmpal.R", print.eval = TRUE)
```

<!-- This is quite an abrupt change of topics and does not connect well with the previous paragraphs on palette options. -->
The **tmap** package offers many methods for specifying how variables are plotted on the map, in addition to setting `breaks` manually as we have already seen in this subsection.
They are set with the `style` argument and some of the most useful methods are illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:break-styles).

<!-- Is there a way to improve the legends, so far they are not really appealaing -->
```{r break-styles, fig.cap="Illustration of different binning methods set using the style argument in tmap.", echo=FALSE}
source("code/09-break-styles.R")
```

<!-- explain and describe classification intervals -->
The default value of `style` is `pretty`.
It automatically rounds breaks values and evenly spaces them.
The `equal` style divides the range of input values into subranges of equal range.
This style is often used on data with regular distribution of values and common values range, such as percentages.
On the other hand, it could produce categories with a large number of elements (points, areas) and those without any observation.
To have the same number of elements in each category, one can use the `quantile` style. 
It is useful for ordinal data <!--examples--> and never produces empty classes. 
This style, however, could have very different values in the same category.
Natural breaks method, also called `jenks`, tries to identify groups of similar values in the data.
Breaks between classes are created to maximize the differences between categories. 
<!-- what do you mean by could be meaningful only for this? Also "Importantly" sentence sounds strange -->
This method provides classes that reflect the values distribution, but at the same time creates classes that could be meaningful only for this dataset.
Importantly, categorical legends described above could be not the most suitable when presenting a large number of objects (e.g. points or polygons) or continuous fields (e.g. continuous rasters).
In these situations, `cont` or `order` can be used. 
The former is appropriate for variables with evenly distributed values, while the latter works well when the distribution of values is skewed (for example, only a few raster cells have very large values).
Finally, the `cat` style should be used to represent categorical values.
It assures that each category receives a unique color.
<!-- references for more info -->

<!-- sth. wrong with the next sentence -->
A variable, which name is provided in the `col` argument, is represented by a color palette.
The default color palette is specified in `tm_layout()` (see section \@ref(layouts) to learn more), however, it could be quickly changed using the `palette` argument.
It expects a vector of colors or a new color palette name, which can be selected interactively with `tmaptools::palette_explorer()`.
What color palette to use, largely depends on the input data type and the purpose of the map.
<!--While this could be an uneasy decision to be made, we can give some advice.-->

There are three main groups of color palettes - categorical, sequential and diverging (Figure \@ref(fig:colpal)), and each of them serves a different purpose.

Categorical palettes consist of easily distinguishable colors and are most appropriate for categorical data without any particular order such as state names or land cover classes.
If possible, the color choice should be intuitive as in the case of blue rivers (and pastures green).
One should also avoid too many categories since this could make a map hard to read.^[The `col = "MAP_COLORS"` argument can be used in situations with a large number of unique object (for example a map of individual countries).]

The second group, sequential palettes, mostly follow a gradient from light to dark colors with the former usually representing lower and the latter representing higher values. 
For this, one can use either a single color (e.g. gradient from light to dark blue) or a multi-hue color combination (e.g. a gradient from light yellow to dark green).
Sequential palettes are most appropriate for mapping quantitative data.

The last group, diverging palettes, typically range between three distinct colors (purple-white-green in Figure \@ref(fig:colpal)) and are usually created by joining two single color sequential palettes with the darker colors at each end.
Their main purpose is too visualize the difference from an important reference point, e.g. a certain temperature, the median household income or the mean probability for a drought event.

<!-- mention bivariate color maps -->
<!-- is it possible to made them with tmap?? -->

  n_colors = length(color_names)
  ylim = c(0, n_colors)
  oldpar = par(mgp = c(2, 0.25, 0))
  on.exit(par(oldpar))
  plot(1, 1, xlim = c(0, max(n)), ylim = ylim,

         col = one_color, border = "light grey")
    }
  text(rep(-0.1, n_colors), (1: n_colors) - 0.6, labels = titles, xpd = TRUE, adj = 1)
}

many_palette_plotter(c("PRGn", "YlGn", "Set2"), 7, 
                     titles = c("Diverging", "Sequential", "Categorical"))
```

### Layouts

The map layout refers to the combination of all map elements into a cohesive map.
Map elements include among others the objects to be mapped, the title, the scale bar, margins and aspect ratios.
<!-- what is the relation of the next two sentences to the general map layout. It sounds more like these should be moved to the palette and break sections. -->
Color settings relate to the palette and break-points used affect how the map looks.
Both may result in subtle changes that can nonetheless have a large impact on the impression left by your maps.

**tmap** allows a wide variety of layout settings to be changed, some of which are illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:layout1), produced using the following code (see `args(tm_layout)` or `?tm_layout` for a full list):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
map_nz + tm_layout(title = "New Zealand")
map_nz + tm_layout(scale = 5)
map_nz + tm_layout(bg.color = "lightblue")
map_nz + tm_layout(frame = FALSE)
```

```{r layout1, fig.cap="Layout options specified by (from left to right) title, scale, bg.color and frame arguments.", echo=FALSE}
source("code/09-layout1.R")
```

The other arguments in `tm_layout()` provide control over many more aspects of the map in relation to the canvas on which it is placed.
Some useful layout settings are listed below (see Figure \@ref(fig:layout2) for illustrations of a selection of these):

- Frame width (`frame.lwd`) and an option to allow double lines (`frame.double.line`).
- Margin settings including `outer.margin` and `inner.margin`.
- Font settings, controlled by `fontface` and `fontfamily`.
- Legend settings including binary options such as `legend.show` (whether or not to show the legend) `legend.only` (omit the map) and `legend.outside` (should the legend go outside the map?), as well as multiple choice settings such as `legend.position`.
- Default colors of aesthetic layers (`aes.color`), map attributes such as the frame (`attr.color`).
- Color settings controlling `sepia.intensity` (how yellowy the map looks) and `saturation` (a color-greyscale).

```{r layout2, fig.cap="Illustration of selected layout options.", echo=FALSE}
# todo: add more useful settings to this plot
source("code/09-layout2.R")
```

The impact of changing the color settings listed above is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:layout3) (see `?tm_layout` for a full list).

```{r layout3, fig.cap="Illustration of selected color-related layout options.", echo=FALSE}
source("code/09-layout3.R")
```

<!-- Maybe reverse order and progress from the high- to the low-level control. Overall, this section reads a bit like a vignette. Is this the intention. -->
Beyond the low-level control over layouts and colors, **tmap** also offers high-level styles, using `tm_style_` functions (representing the second meaning of 'style' in the package).
Some styles such as `tm_style_cobalt()` result in stylized maps while others such as `tm_style_grey()` make more subtle changes, as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:tmstyles), created using code below (see `09-tmstyles.R`):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
map_nza + tm_style_bw()
map_nza + tm_style_classic()
map_nza + tm_style_cobalt()
map_nza + tm_style_col_blind()
```

```{r tmstyles, fig.cap="Selected tmap styles: bw, classic, cobalt and color blind (from left to right).", echo=FALSE}
source("code/09-tmstyles.R")
```

```{block2 styles, type='rmdnote'}
A preview of predefined styles can be generated by executing `tmap_style_catalogue()`.
This creates a folder called `tmap_style_previews` containing (in **tmap** 2.0) 10 images.
Each image, from `tm_style_albatross.png` to `tm_style_white.png` shows a faceted map of Europe in the corresponding style.
Note: `tmap_style_catalogue()` takes some time to run.
```

### Faceted maps

Faceted maps, also referred to as 'small multiples', are composed of many maps arranged side-by-side, and sometimes stacked vertically.
Facets enable the visualization of how spatial relationships change with respect to another variable, such as time.
The changing populations of settlements, for example, can be represented in a faceted map with each panel representing the population at a particular moment in time.
The time dimension could be represented via another *aesthetic* such as color.
However, this risks cluttering the map because it will involve multiple overlapping points (cities do not tend to move over time!).

Typically all individual facets in a faceted map contain the same geometry data repeated multiple times, once for each column in the attribute data (this is the default plotting method for `sf` objects, as we saw in Chapter \@ref(#spatial-class)).
However, facets can also represent shifting geometries such as as the evolution of a point pattern over time.
This use case of faceted plot is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:urban-facet).

<!-- todo: describe data type (long) and nrow vs ncol -->

```{r urban-facet, fig.cap="Faceted map showing the top 30 largest 'urban agglomerations' from 1970 to 2030 based on population projects by the United Nations.", fig.asp=0.4}
urb_1970_2030 = urban_agglomerations %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(1970, 1990, 2010, 2030))
tm_shape(world) + tm_polygons() + 
  tm_shape(urb_1970_2030) +
  tm_dots(size = "population_millions") +
  tm_facets(by = "year", nrow = 2, free.coords = FALSE)
```

The preceding code chunk demonstrates key features of faceted maps created with **tmap**:

- Shapes that do not have a facet variable are repeated (the countries in `world` in this case).
- The `by` argument which varies depending on a variable (`year` in this case).
- `nrow`/`ncol` setting specifying the number of rows and columns that facets should be arranged into.
- The `free.coords`-parameter specifying if each map has its own bounding box.

In addition to their utility for showing changing spatial relationships, faceted maps are also useful as the foundation for animated maps (see \@ref(animated-maps)).

### Inset maps

An inset map is a smaller map rendered within or next to the main map. 
<!-- I would say inset maps are usually used for the opposite. This is we have a specific area, say a mountain somewhere in Peru, and the inset map shows were in Peru the mountain is located, see Figure 3 in https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-067/RJ-2017-067.pdf
and
http://wiki.gis.com/wiki/index.php/Inset_Map
So maybe it would be an idea to focus on the NZ Alps raster map as the main map and use NZ within the inset map.
Maybe this section is also a bit too long. How about shortening it, and maybe use the US example as a challenge in the exercise section.
-->
Inset maps usually cover an area with densely located phenomena that cannot be clearly visible at the original map scale.
They could be used to focus on a smaller area in more detail (Figure \@ref(fig:insetmap1)) or to bring some non-contiguous regions closer to ease their comparison (Figure \@ref(fig:insetmap2)).
<!-- find the best distribution of insets 
In this section we focus on a creation of inset maps, so to learn about map styling go to section \@ref(aesthetics).
-->

In the example below, we create an inset map of the central part of the New Zealand's Southern Alps.
The first step is to define the area of interest, which can be done by creating a new spatial object, `nz_region`.
<!--# mapview::mapview(nz_height, native.crs = TRUE) or mapedit??-->

```{r}
nz_region = st_bbox(c(xmin = 1340000, xmax = 1450000, ymin = 5130000, ymax = 5210000),
                    crs = st_crs(nz_height)) %>% 
  st_as_sfc() 
```

In the second step, we create a base map showing a lager area. 
It gives a context and helps to locate the area of interest. 
Importantly, this map needs to clearly indicate the location of the inset map, for example by stating its borders.

```{r}
nz_map = tm_shape(nz) +
  tm_polygons() +
  tm_shape(nz_height) +
  tm_symbols(shape = 2, col = "red", size = 0.1) + 
  tm_shape(nz_region) +
  tm_borders(lwd = 3) + 
  tm_layout(frame = FALSE)
```

The third step consists of the inset map creation. 
This is a place where the most important message is stated. 

```{r}
nz_height_map = tm_shape(nz_elev, bbox = tmaptools::bb(nz_region)) +
  tm_raster(style = "cont", palette = "-Spectral",
            auto.palette.mapping = FALSE, legend.show = FALSE) +
  tm_shape(nz_height) +
  tm_symbols(shape = 2, col = "red", size = 0.1)
```

Finally, we combine the two maps.
A viewport from the **grid** package can be used by stating a center location (`x` and `y`) and a size (`width` and `height`) of the inset map.

```{r insetmap1, fig.cap="Inset map showing the central part of the Southern Alps in New Zealand."}
library(grid)
nz_map
print(nz_height_map, vp = grid::viewport(0.3, 0.7, width = 0.4, height = 0.4))
```

Inset map can be save to file either by using a graphic device (see section \@ref(visual-outputs)) or the `tmap_save()` function and its arguments - `insets_tm` and `insets_vp`.

Inset maps are also used to create one map of non-contiguous areas.
Probably, the most often use example is a map of United States, which consists of the contiguous United States, Hawaii and Alaska.
It is very important to find the best projection for each individual inset in this type of cases (see section \@ref(reproj-geo-data) to learn more).
We can use US National Atlas Equal Area for the map of the contiguous United States by putting its EPSG code in the `projection` argument of `tm_shape()`.

```{r}
us_states_map = tm_shape(us_states, projection = 2163) +
  tm_polygons() + 
  tm_layout(frame = FALSE)
```

The rest of our objects, `hawaii` and `alaska`, already have proper projections, therefore we just need to create two separate maps:

```{r}
hawaii_map = tm_shape(hawaii) +
  tm_polygons() + 
  tm_layout(title = "Hawaii", frame = FALSE, bg.color = NA, 
            title.position = c("left", "bottom"))
alaska_map = tm_shape(alaska) +
  tm_polygons() + 
  tm_layout(title = "Alaska", frame = FALSE, bg.color = NA)
```

The final map is created by combining and arranging these three maps:

```{r insetmap2, fig.cap="Map of the United States."}
us_states_map
print(hawaii_map, vp = viewport(x = 0.4, y = 0.1, width = 0.2, height = 0.1))
print(alaska_map, vp = viewport(x = 0.15, y = 0.15, width = 0.3, height = 0.3))
```

The code presented above is very compact and allows for creation of many similar maps, however the map do not represent sizes and locations of Hawaii and Alaska well.
You can see an alternative approach in the [`vignettes/us-map.Rmd`](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/blob/master/vignettes/us-map.Rmd) file in the book's GitHub repo, which tries to mitigate this issues.

<!-- extended info about using tm_layout to show legend in main plot and remove it in the others -->
The main goal of this section is to present how to generate and arrange inset maps.
The next step is to use the knowledge from the previous sections to improve the map style or to add another data layers.
Moreover, the same skills can be applied to combine maps and plots.

## Animated maps

Faceted maps, described in \@ref(faceted-maps), provide a way of showing how spatial relationships vary but the approach has disadvantages.
Facets become tiny when many of them are squeezed into a single plot, potentially hiding *any* spatial relationships.
Furthermore the fact that each facet is separated by space on the screen or page means that subtle differences between facets can be hard to detect.

With an increasing proportion of communication happening via digital screens, animated maps are becoming more popular.
Animated maps can even be useful for paper reports: you can always link readers to a web-page containing an animated (or interactive) version of a printed map to help make it come alive.

Figure \@ref(fig:urban-animated) is a simple example of an animated map.
Unlike the faceted plot it does not squeeze multiple maps into a single screen and allows the reader to see how the spatial distribution of the worlds most populous agglomerations evolve over time (see the book's website for the animated version).

```{r urban-animated, fig.cap="Animated map showing the top 30 largest 'urban agglomerations' from 1950 to 2030 based on population projects by the United Nations.", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/urban-animated.gif")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
source("code/09-urban-animation.R")
```

The animated map illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:urban-animated) can be created using the same **tmap** techniques that generates faceted maps, demonstrated in section \@ref(faceted-maps).
There are two differences, however, related to arguments in `tm_facets()`:

- `free.coords = FALSE`, which maintains the map extent for each map iteration
- `nrow = 1` and `ncol = 1` ensure only one facet is created per year

These additional arguments are demonstrated in the subsequent code chunk:

```{r}
urb_anim = tm_shape(world) +
  tm_polygons() + 
  tm_shape(urban_agglomerations) +
  tm_dots(size = "population_millions") +
  tm_facets(by = "year", free.coords = FALSE, nrow = 1, ncol = 1)
```

The resulting `urb_anim` represents a set of separate maps for each year.
The final stage is to combine them and save the result as a `.gif` file with `tmap_animation()`.
The following command creates the animation illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:urban-animated), with a few elements missing, that we will add-in during the exercises:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tmap_animation(urb_anim, filename = "urb_anim.gif", delay = 25)
```

<!-- Though the second animation is great, I wonder if it is necessary here, especially if the underlying code is not explained in more detail. So this could be also a great challenge for the exercise section?
-->
Another illustration of the power of animated maps is provided in Figure \@ref(fig:animus).
This shows the colonization of the United States, which moved progressively from the East to the West and finally into the interior.
Code to reproduce this map can be found in the script `09-usboundaries.R`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
source("code/09-usboundaries.R")
source("code/09-uscolonize.R")
```


```{r animus, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Animated map showing population growth and colonization in the United States."}
u_animus = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1825120/38543030-5794b6f0-3c9b-11e8-9da9-10ec1f3ea726.gif"
knitr::include_graphics(u_animus)
```

## Interactive maps

The easiest way to create an interactive map to view spatial data in R is with the **mapview** package, as illustrated in the following 'one liner':

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mapview::mapview(nz)
```

```{r mapview, fig.cap="Illustration of mapview in action.", echo=FALSE}
mv = mapview::mapview(nz)
mv@map
```

<!-- leaflet plugins -->

## Web mapping applications with shiny

The interactive web maps demonstrated in section \@ref(interactive-maps) can go far.
Careful selection of layers to display, base-maps and pop-ups can be used to communicate the main results of many projects involving geocomputation.
But the web mapping approach to interactivity has limitations:

- Although the map is interactive in terms of panning, zooming and clicking, the code is static, meaning the user interface is fixed.
- All map content is generally static in a web map, meaning that web maps cannot scale to handle large datasets easily.
- Additional layers of interactivity, such a graphs showing relationships between variables and 'dashboards' are difficult to create using the web-mapping approach.

Overcoming these limitations involves going beyond static web mapping and towards geospatial frameworks and map servers.
Products in this field include [GeoDjango](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/contrib/gis/) (which extends the Django web framework and is written in [Python](https://github.com/django/django)), [MapGuide](https://www.osgeo.org/projects/mapguide-open-source/) (a framework for developing web applications, largely written in [C++](https://trac.osgeo.org/mapguide/wiki/MapGuideArchitecture)) and [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/) (a mature and powerful map server written in [Java](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver)).
Each of these (particularly GeoServer) is scalable, enabling maps  to be served to thousands of people daily --- assuming there is sufficient public interest in your maps!
The bad news is that such server-side solutions require much skilled developer time to set-up and maintain, often involving teams of people with roles such as a dedicated geospatial database administrator ([DBA](http://wiki.gis.com/wiki/index.php/Database_administrator)).

The good news is that web mapping applications can now be rapidly created using **shiny**, a package for converting R code into interactive web applications.
This is thanks to its support for interactive maps via functions such as `renderLeaflet()`, documented on the [Shiny integration](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/shiny.html) section of RStudio's **leaflet** website.
This section some context, teaches the basics of **shiny** from a web mapping perspective and culminates in a full-screen mapping application in less than 100 lines of code.

The way **shiny** works is well documented at [shiny.rstudio.com](https://shiny.rstudio.com/).
The two key elements of a **shiny** app reflect the duality common to most web application development: 'front end' (the bit the user sees) and 'back end' code.
In **shiny** apps these elements are typically created in objects named `ui` and `server` within an R script named `app.R`, that lives in an 'app folder'.
This allows web mapping applications to be represented in a single file, such as the [`coffeeApp/app.R`](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/blob/master/coffeeApp/app.R) file in the book's GitHub repo.

```{block2 shiny, type = 'rmdnote'}
In **shiny** apps these are often split into `ui.R` (short for user interface) and `server.R` files, naming conventions used by [`shiny-server`](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-server), a server-side Linux application for serving shiny apps on public-facing websites
`shiny-server` also serves apps defined by a single `app.R` file in an 'app folder'.
```

Before considering large apps it is worth seeing a minimal example, named 'lifeApp', in action.^[
The word 'app' in this context refers to 'web application' and should not be confused with smartphone apps, the more common meaning of the word.
]
The code below defines and launches --- with the command `shinyApp()` --- a lifeApp, which provides an interactive slider allowing users to make countries appear with progressively lower levels of life expectancy (see Figure \@ref(fig:lifeApp)):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui = fluidPage(
  sliderInput(inputId = "life", "Life expectancy", 0, 80, value = 80),
      leafletOutput(outputId = "map")
  )
server = function(input, output) {
  output$map = renderLeaflet({
    leaflet() %>% addProviderTiles("OpenStreetMap.BlackAndWhite") %>%
      addPolygons(data = world[world$lifeExp > input$life, ])})
}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

```{r lifeApp, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Minimal example of a web mapping application created with **shiny**."}
knitr::include_app("https://bookdown.org/robinlovelace/lifeapp/")
```

The **user interface** (`ui`) of lifeApp is created by `fluidPage()`.
This contains input 'widgets' --- a `sliderInput()` in this case (many other `*Input()` functions are available) --- and outputs, a `leafletOutput()` in this case.
Elements added to a `fluidPage()` are arranged row-wise by default, explaining why the slider interface is placed directly above the map in Figure \@ref(fig:lifeApp) (`?column` explains how to add content column-wise).
The **server side** (`server`) is a function with `input` and `output` arguments.
`output` is a list of objects containing elements generated by `render*()` function --- `renderLeaflet()` which generates `output$map` in this case.
Inputs elements such as `input$life` referred to in the server must relate to elements that exist in the `ui` --- defined by `inputId = "life"` in the code above.
The function `shinyApp()` combines both the `ui` and `server` elements and serves the results interactively via a new R process.
When you move the slider in in Figure \@ref(fig:lifeApp), you are actually causing R code to re-run, although this is hidden from view in the user interface.

Building on this basic example and knowing where to find help (see `?shiny`), the best way forward may be to stop reading and start programming!
The recommended next step is to open the previously mentioned [`coffeeApp/app.R`](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/blob/master/coffeeApp/app.R) script in an IDE of choice, modify it and re-run it repeatedly.
The example contains some of the components of a web mapping application implemented in **shiny** and should 'shine' a light on how they behave (pun intended).
The `coffeeApp/app.R` script contains **shiny** functions that go beyond those demonstrated in the simple 'lifeApp' example.
These include `reactive()` and `observe()` (for creating outputs that respond to the user interface --- see `?reactive`) and `leafletProxy()` (for modifying a `leaflet` object that has already been created).
Such elements are critical to the creation of web mapping applications implemented in **shiny**.

```{block shinynote, type='rmdnote'}
There are a number of ways to run a **shiny** app.
For RStudio users the simplest way is probably to click on the 'Run App' button located in the top right of the source pane when an `app.R`, `ui.R` or `server.R` script is open.
**shiny** apps can also be initiated by using `runApp()` with the first argument being the folder containing the app code and data: `runApp("coffeeApp")` in this case (which assumes a folder named `coffeeApp` containing the `app.R` script is in your working directory).
You can also launch apps from a Unix command line with the command `Rscript -e 'shiny::runApp("coffeeApp")'`.
```

Experimenting with apps such as `coffeeApp` will build not only your knowledge of web mapping applications in R but your practical skills.
Changing the contents of `setView()`, for example, will change the starting bounding box that the user sees when the app is initiated.
Such experimentation should not be done at random, but with reference to relevant documentation, starting with `?shiny`, and motivated by a desire to solve problems such as those posed in the exercises.

**shiny** used in this way can make prototyping mapping applications faster and more accessible than ever before (deploying **shiny** apps is a separate topic beyond the scope of this chapter).
Even if your applications are eventually deployed using different technologies, **shiny** undoubtedly allows web mapping applications to be developed in relatively few lines of code (60 in the case of coffeeApp).
That does not stop shiny apps getting rather large.
The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) hosted at [pct.bike](http://www.pct.bike/), for example, is a national mapping tool funded by the UK's Department for Transport.
The PCT is used by dozens of people each day and has multiple interactive elements based on more than 1000 lines of [code](https://github.com/npct/pct-shiny/blob/master/regions_www/m/server.R) [@lovelace_propensity_2017].

While such apps undoubtedly take time and effort to develop, **shiny** provides a framework for reproducible prototyping that should aid the development process.
One potential problem with the ease of developing prototypes with **shiny** is the temptation to start programming too early, before the purpose of the mapping application has been envisioned in detail.
For that reason, despite advocating **shiny**, we recommend starting with the longer established technology of a pen and paper as the first stage for interactive mapping projects.
This way your prototype web applications should be limited not by technical considerations but by your motivations and imagination.

## Other mapping packages

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(globe)
```

**tmap** provides a powerful interface for creating a wide range of static maps (section \@ref(interactive-maps) shows how **tmap** also supports interactive maps).
<!-- if this section is on static map production, it should be part of section static maps -->
But there are many other options for creating static maps.
The aim of this section is to provide a taster of some of these and pointers for additional resources: map making is a surprisingly active area of R package development so there is more to learn than can be covered here.

<!-- maybe this should be separated from basic-map and basic-map-raster
Also really doesn't belong here since the section header is other mapping packages-->
The most mature option is to use `plot()` methods provided by core spatial packages **sf** and **raster**, covered in sections \@ref(basic-map) and \@ref(basic-map-raster) respectively.
What we have not mentioned in those sections was that plot methods for raster and vector objects can be combined, as illustrated in the subsequent code chunk which generates Figure \@ref(fig:nz-plot).
`plot()` has many options which can be explored by following links in the `?plot` help page and the **sf** vignette [`sf5`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/vignettes/sf5.html).

```{r nz-plot, fig.cap="Map of New Zealand created with plot(). The legend to the left refers to elevation (1000 m above sea level)."}
g = st_graticule(nz, lon = c(170, 175), lat = c(-45, -40, -35))
plot(nz_water, graticule = g, axes = TRUE, col = "blue")
raster::plot(nz_elev / 1000, add = TRUE)
plot(st_geometry(nz), add = TRUE)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# RgoogleMaps example: not working
nz_cent = st_union(nz) %>% st_centroid()
bg_map = RgoogleMaps::GetMap(center = c(40, -176), zoom = 9)
nz_wgs = st_transform(nz, 3857)
plot(st_geometry(nz_wgs), bgMap = bg_map)
```

Since version 2.2.2, the **tidyverse** plotting package **ggplot2** has supported `sf` objects with `geom_sf()`.
The syntax is similar to that used by **tmap**:
an initial `ggplot()` call is followed by one or more layers, that are added with `+ geom_*()`, where `*` represents a layer type such as `geom_sf()` (for sf objects) or `geom_points()` (for points).

**ggplot2** plots graticules by default.
The default settings for the graticules can be overridden using `scale_x_continuous()` and `scale_y_continuous()`.
Other notable features include the use of unquoted variable names encapsulated in `aes()` to indicate which aesthetics vary and switching data sources using the `data` argument, as demonstrated in the code chunk below which creates Figure \@ref(fig:nz-gg):

```{r nz-gg, fig.cap="Map of New Zealand created with ggplot2."}
library(ggplot2)
g1 = ggplot() + geom_sf(data = nz, aes(fill = col)) +
  geom_sf(data = nz_height) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(170, 175))
g1
```

An advantage of **ggplot2** is that it has a strong user-community and many add-on packages.
Good additional resources can be found in the open source [ggplot2-book](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book) and in the descriptions of the multitude of '**gg**packages' such as **ggrepel** and **tidygraph**.

Another benefit of maps based on **ggplot2** is that they can easily be given a level of interactivity when printed using the function `ggplotly()` from the **plotly** package.
Try `plotly::ggplotly(g1)` for example, and compare the result with other **plotly** mapping functions described at [blog.cpsievert.me](https://blog.cpsievert.me/2018/03/30/visualizing-geo-spatial-data-with-sf-and-plotly/).

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
plotly::ggplotly(g1)
```

We have covered mapping with **sf**, **raster** and **ggplot2** packages first because these packages are highly flexible, allowing for the creation of a wide range of static maps.
Many other static mapping packages are more specific.

<!-- JM: alternative mapping solutions are still missing -->
Before we cover mapping packages for plotting a specific type of map (in the next paragraph), it is worth considering alternatives to the packages already covered for general-purpose static mapping (Table \@ref(tab:map-pkgs)).

```{r map-pkgs, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
pkg_df = read_csv("extdata/map_pkgs.csv")
map_pkgs_df = dplyr::select(pkg_df, package, title, latest_release = published)
map_pkgs_df$title[map_pkgs_df$package == "leaflet"] =
  "Create Interactive Web Maps with Leaflet"
knitr::kable(map_pkgs_df, caption = "Selected mapping packages, with associated metrics.")
```

Table \@ref(tab:map-pkgs) shows a range of mapping packages are available, and there are many others not listed in this table.
Of note is **cartography**, which generates a range of unusual maps including choropleth, 'proportional symbol' and 'flow' maps, each of which is documented in the vignette [`cartography`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cartography/vignettes/cartography.html).

## Exercises
<!-- Exercises are still missing -->
1. Sketch out on paper ideas for a web mapping app that could be used to make transport or land-use policies more evidence based:
  - In the city you live in, for a couple of users per day
  - In the country you live in, for dozens of users per day
  - Worldwide for hundreds of users per day and large data serving requirements
1. How would app design, deployment and project management decisions change as the scale of map deployment increases? 
1. Update the code in `coffeeApp/app.R` so that instead of centering on Brazil the user can select which country to focus on:
    - Using `textInput()`
    - Using `selectInput()`
