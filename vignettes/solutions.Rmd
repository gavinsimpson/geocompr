knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, comment = "#>")
```

## Prerequisites {-}

The solutions assume the following packages are loaded (other packages will be loaded when needed):

```{r packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(spData)
```

# Chapter 1

1. Think about the terms 'GIS', 'GDS' and 'Geocomputation' described above. Which is your favorite and and why?

1. Provide 3 reasons for using a scriptable language such R for geocomputation instead of established GIS programs such as QGIS.

- Reproducibility: a sequence of operations is much easier to save and share when using a scripting language.
- Scalability: scripting languages make it easy to break-up the work and parallelise, making it more scalable.
- Flexibility: the building blocks of the language allows it to interface efficiently with external software, enabling R to perform a wide range of tasks (e.g. animations, online interactive maps).
- Efficiency: the GUI of GIS programs can be slow to use and install.

1. Name two advantages and two disadvantages of using the older **sp** package compared with the new **sf** package.

- `+` Number of packages supported.
- `+` Stability
- `-` Slow performance
- `-` Non standard data format

# Chapter 2


<!-- vector exercises -->
1. What does the summary of the `geometry` column tell us about the `world` dataset, in terms of:
    - The geometry type?
    - How many countries there are?
    - The coordinate reference system (CRS)?

2. Using **sf**'s `plot()` command, create a map of Nigeria in context, building on the code that creates and plots Asia above (see Figure \@ref(fig:asia) for an example of what this could look like). 
    - Hint: this used the `lwd`, `main` and `col` arguments of `plot()`. 
    - Bonus: make the country boundaries a dotted grey line.
    - Hint: `border` is an additional argument of `plot()` for **sf**  objects.

```{r nigeria, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Map of Nigeria in context illustrating sf's plotting capabilities"}
nigeria = world[world$name_long == "Nigeria", ]
africa = world[world$continent == "Africa", ]
bb_africa = st_bbox(africa)
plot(africa[2], col = "white", lwd = 3, main = "Nigeria in context", border = "lightgrey")
# plot(world, lty = 3, add = TRUE, border = "grey")
plot(world, add = TRUE, border = "grey")
plot(nigeria, col = "yellow", add = TRUE, border = "darkgrey")
ncentre = st_centroid(nigeria)
ncentre_num = st_coordinates(ncentre)
text(x = ncentre_num[1], y = ncentre_num[2], labels = "Nigeria")
```

3. What does the `cex` argument do in the `plot()` function that generates Figure \@ref(fig:contpop)?
    - Why was `cex` passed the `sqrt(world$pop) / 10000` instead of just the population directly?
    - Bonus: what equivalent arguments to `cex` exist in the dedicated vizualisation package **tmap**?
    
4. Re-run the code that 'generated' Figure \@ref(fig:contpop) at the end of \@ref(base-args) and find 3 similarities and 3 differences between the plot produced on your computer and that in the book.
    - What is similar?
        - The map orientation (north is up), colors of the continents and sizes of the circles are the same, among other things.
    - What has changed?
        - The shape of the countries (an equal area projection has been used), the color of the points has changed (to red) and are now filled in (using the `pch` argument to change the point symbol), the plot has graticules and (most subtly) the points are now in the centroid of the largest polygon of each country, rather than in the area-weighted centroid across all polygons per country.
    - Bonus: play around with and research base plotting arguments to make your version of Figure \@ref(fig:contpop) more attractive. Which arguments were most useful.
        - This is a subjective question: have fun!
    - Advanced: try to reproduce the map presented in Figure \@ref(base-args). Copy-and-pasting is prohibited!
        - You can *look* at the code that generated the plot here: https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/blob/master/02-spatial-data.Rmd . If you memorise its important parts, and type them in your own script to reproduce the code that does not count as cheating. That will be a valuable learning experience.

<!-- raster exercises -->
5. Read the `raster/nlcd2011.tif` file from the **spDataLarge** package. 
What kind of information can you get about the properties of this file?
<!-- (crs, ncols, nrow, ncells, bbox, navalues) -->
6. Create an empty `RasterLayer` object called `my_raster` with 10 columns and 10 rows, and resolution of 10 units.
Assign random values between 0 and 10 to the new raster and plot it.
<!-- crs exercises -->
<!-- 1. pros and cons of the projection types -->
<!-- 1. what's the difference between vector and raster transformation -->
<!-- units exercises -->
<!-- 1. ?? -->

3. Exercise 3 <!--missing title-->

- What does the `lwd` argument do in the `plot()` code that generates Figure \@ref(fig:africa). 
- Perform the same operations and map making for another continent of your choice.
- Bonus: Download some global geographic data and add attribute variables assigning them to the continents of the world.

# Chapter 3

<!-- Attribute subsetting -->
1. Select only the `NAME` column in `us_states` and create a new object called `us_states_name`. 
What is the class of the new object? <!--why there is a "sf" part? -->
```{r}
us_states_name = us_states %>% dplyr::select(NAME)
class(us_states_name)
```
2. Select columns which contain information about a total population.
Think about as many ways as possible to do it. 
Hint: try to use helper functions, such as `contains` or `starts_with`.
```{r}
us_states %>% select(total_pop_10, total_pop_15)
```
```{r}
us_states %>% select(starts_with("total_pop"))
```
```{r}
us_states %>% select(contains("total_pop"))
```
3. Find all states that:
- Belongs to the Midwest region
```{r}
us_states %>% filter(total_pop_15 < 750000)
```
- Had a total population in 2015 lower than 750,000 residents
```{r}
us_states %>% filter(total_pop_15 < 750000)
```
- Belongs to the West region, had an area smaller than 250,000 km^2^ and total population in 2015 larger than 5,000,000 residents
```{r}
us_states %>% filter(REGION == "West", AREA < units::set_units(250000, km^2),total_pop_15 > 5000000)
# or
us_states %>% filter(REGION == "West", as.numeric(AREA) < 250000,total_pop_15 > 5000000)
```
- Belongs to the South region, had an area larger than 150,000 km^2^ or total population in 2015 larger than 7,000,000 residents
```{r}
us_states %>% filter(REGION == "South", AREA > units::set_units(150000, km^2), total_pop_15 > 7000000)
# or
us_states %>% filter(REGION == "South", as.numeric(AREA) > 150000, total_pop_15 > 7000000)
```
<!-- 4. Exercises about additional select and filter helper functions (one_of; between, is.na, near, etc.) -->
<!-- Attribute aggregation -->
4. What was the total population in 2015 in the `us_states` database? What was the minimum and maximum total population in 2015?
```{r}
us_states %>% summarize(total_pop = sum(total_pop_15),
                        min_pop = min(total_pop_15),
                        max_pop = max(total_pop_15))
```
5. How many states are in each region?
```{r}
us_states %>%
  group_by(REGION) %>%
  summarize(nr_of_states = n())
```
6. What was the minimum and maximum total population in 2015 in each region? What was the total population in 2015 in each region?
```{r}
us_states %>%
  group_by(REGION) %>%
  summarize(min_pop = min(total_pop_15),
            max_pop = max(total_pop_15),
            tot_pop = sum(total_pop_15))
```
<!-- Attribute joining -->
7. Add variables from `us_states_df` to `us_states` and create a new object called `us_states_stats`. What is the best function to do it? Which variable is the key in the both datasets? What is the class of a new object?
```{r}
us_states_stats = us_states %>%
  left_join(us_states_df, by = c("NAME" = "state"))
class(us_states_stats)
```
8. `us_states_df` has two more variables than `us_states`. How you can find them?
```{r}
us_states_df %>%
  anti_join(us_states, by = c("state" = "NAME"))
```
<!-- Attribute creation -->
9. What was the population density in 2015 in each state? What was the population density in 2010 in each state?
```{r}
us_states2 = us_states %>%
  mutate(pop_dens_15 = total_pop_15/AREA,
         pop_dens_10 = total_pop_10/AREA)
```
10. How much the population density changed between 2010 and 2015 in each state? Calculate the change in percentages.
```{r}
us_states2 %>%
  mutate(pop_dens_diff_10_15 = pop_dens_15 - pop_dens_10,
         pop_dens_diff_10_15p = (pop_dens_diff_10_15/pop_dens_15) * 100)
```
11. Change the columns names in `us_states` to lowercase. Try to use two helper functions - `tolower()` and `colnames()`.
```{r}
us_states %>%
  set_names(tolower(colnames(.)))
```
<!-- Mixed exercises -->
<!-- combination of use of select, mutate, group_by, summarize, etc  -->
12. Using `us_states` and `us_states_df` create a new object called `us_states_sel`. The new object should have only two variables - `median_income_15` and `geometry`. Change the name of the `median_income_15` column to `Income`.
```{r}
us_states %>%
  left_join(us_states_df, by = c("NAME" = "state")) %>%
  select(Income = median_income_15)
```
13. Calculate the change in median income between 2010 and 2015 for each state. What was the minimum, average and maximum median income in 2015 for each region? What is the region with the largest increase of the median income?
```{r}
us_states %>%
  left_join(us_states_df, by = c("NAME" = "state")) %>%
  mutate(income_change = median_income_15 - median_income_10) %>%
  group_by(REGION) %>%
  summarize(min_income_change = min(income_change),
            mean_income_change = mean(income_change),
            max_income_change = max(income_change)) %>%
  filter(mean_income_change == max(mean_income_change)) %>%
  pull(REGION) %>%
  as.character()
```

14. Create a raster from scratch with nine rows and columns and a resolution of 0.5 decimal degrees (WGS84).
Fill it with random numbers.
Extract the values of the four corner cells. 
```{r}
library(raster)
r = raster(nrow = 9, ncol = 9, res = 0.5, xmn = 0, xmx = 4.5,
           ymn = 0, ymx = 4.5, vals = rnorm(81))
# using cell IDs
r[c(1, 9, 81 - 9, 81)]
# using indexing
r[c(1, nrow(r)), c(1, ncol(r))]
# corresponds to [1, 1], [1, 9], [9, 1], [9, 9]
```
15. What is the most common class of our example raster `grain` (hint: `modal()`)?
```{r}
grain_size = c("clay", "silt", "sand")
grain = raster(nrow = 6, ncol = 6, res = 0.5, 
               xmn = -1.5, xmx = 1.5, ymn = -1.5, ymx = 1.5,
               vals = factor(sample(grain_size, 36, replace = TRUE), 
                             levels = grain_size))
cellStats(grain, modal) %>%
  factorValues(grain, .)
factorValues(grain, modal(values(grain)))
```
16. Plot the histogram and the boxplot of the `data(dem, package = "RQGIS")` raster. 
```{r}
data(dem, package = "RQGIS")
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
hist(dem)
boxplot(dem)
```
17. Now attach also `data(ndvi, package = "RQGIS")`. 
Create a raster stack using `dem` and `ndvi`, and make a `pairs()` plot
```{r}
data(ndvi, package = "RQGIS")
s = stack(dem, ndvi)
pairs(s)
```

# Chapter 4

4. Use `data(dem, package = "RQGIS")`, and reclassify the elevation in three classes: low, middle and high.
Secondly, compute the NDVI (`data(ndvi, package = "RQGIS")`) and the mean elevation for each altitudinal class.
```{r}
library(classInt)
data(dem, package = "RQGIS")
summary(dem)
# find quantile breaks
brk = classIntervals(values(dem), n = 3)$brk
# also try
# breask = classIntervals(values(dem), n = 3, style = "fisher")
# construct reclassification matrix
rcl = matrix(c(brk[1] - 1, brk[2], 1, brk[2], brk[3], 2, brk[3], brk[4], 3), 
             ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
# reclassify altitudinal raster
recl = reclassify(dem, rcl = rcl)
# compute the mean dem and ndvi values for each class
zonal(stack(dem, ndvi), recl, fun = "mean")
```

5. Apply a line detection filter to `data(dem, package = "RQGIS")`.
```{r}
# from the focal help page:
# Laplacian filter: filter=matrix(c(0,1,0,1,-4,1,0,1,0), nrow=3)
# Sobel filter: filter=matrix(c(1,2,1,0,0,0,-1,-2,-1) / 4, nrow=3)
# compute the Sobel filter
# check if there are NAs
is.na(dem)  # just 0s, so no NAs
sobel = focal(dem, w = matrix(c(1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, -2, -1) / 4, nrow = 3))
# CHECK IF THIS IS CORRECT
```

6. Calculate the NDVI of a Landsat image. 
Use the Landsat image provided by the **spDataLarge** package (`system.file("raster/landsat.tif", package="spDataLarge")`).
```{r}
file = system.file("raster/landsat.tif", package="spDataLarge")
r = stack(file)
# compute NDVI manually
ndvi = (r[["landsat.4"]] - r[["landsat.3"]]) / (r[["landsat.4"]] + r[["landsat.3"]])
# compute NDVI with the help of RStoolbox
library(RStoolbox)
ndvi_rstoolbox = spectralIndices(r, red = 3, nir = 4, indices = "NDVI")
all.equal(ndvi, ndvi_rstoolbox)
```

7. This [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35555709/global-raster-of-geographic-distances) shows how to use `raster::distance()`.
Extract Spain, calculate a distance raster and weight it with elevation.
Finally, compute the difference between the raster using the euclidean distance and the raster weighted by elevation.
(Hint: Have a look at `getData()` to retrieve a digital elevation model for Spain.)
```{r}
library(raster)
# find out the ISO_3 code of Spain
dplyr::filter(ccodes(), NAME %in% "Spain")
# retrieve a dem of Spain
dem = getData("alt", country = "ESP", mask = FALSE)
# change the resolution to decrease computing time
agg = aggregate(dem, fact = 5)
poly = getData("GADM", country = "ESP", level = 1)
plot(dem)
plot(poly, add = TRUE)
# visualize NAs
plot(is.na(agg))
# construct a distance input raster
# we have to set the land cells to NA and the sea cells to an arbitrary value since 
# raster::distance computes the distance to the nearest non-NA cell
dist = is.na(agg)
cellStats(dist, summary)
# convert land cells into NAs and sea cells into 1s
dist[dist == FALSE] = NA
dist[dist == TRUE] = 1
plot(dist)
# compute distance to nearest non-NA cell
dist = raster::distance(dist)
# just keep Spain
dist = mask(dist, poly)
# convert distance into km
dist = dist / 1000
# now let's weight each 100 altitudinal meters by an additionaly distance of 10 km
agg = mask(agg, poly)
agg[agg < 0] = 0
weight = dist + agg / 100 * 10
plot(weight - dist)
```

# Chapter 5

# Chapter 8 Location analysis

1. Donwload the csv file containing inhabitant information for a 100 m cell resolution ( https://www.zensus2011.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Pressemitteilung/DemografischeGrunddaten/csv_Bevoelkerung_100m_Gitter.zip?__blob=publicationFile&v=3).
Please note that the unzipped file has a size of 1.23 GB.
To read it into R you can use `readr::read_csv`.
This takes 30 seconds on my machine (16 GB RAM)
`data.table::fread()` might be even faster, and returns an object of class `data.table()`.
Use `as.tibble()` to convert it into a tibble.
Build an inhabitant raster, aggregate it to a cell resolution of 1 km, and compare the difference with the inhabitant raster (`inh`) we have created using class mean values.

# Chapter R-GIS bridges

1. Create two overlapping polygons (`poly_1` and `poly_2`) with the help of the **sf**-package (see chapter \@ref(spatial-class)).

2. Run `data(dem, package = "RQGIS")` and `data(random_points, package = "RQGIS")`.
Select randomly a point from `random_points` and find all `dem` pixels that can be seen from this point (hint: viewshed).
Visualize your result.
For example, plot a hillshade, and on top of it the digital elevation model, your viewshed output and the point.
Additionally, give `mapview` a try.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(RQGIS)

# Chapter Spatial cross-validation

1. Compute the terrain attributes slope, plan curvature, profile curvature and catchment area from `dem` (provided by `data("landslides", package = "RSAGA")`) with the help of R-GIS bridges, and extract the values from the corresponding output rasters to the `landslides` dataframe (`data(landslides, package = "RSAGA"`)). Keep all landslide initation points and 175 randomly selected non-landslide points.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# attach packages

# attach data
data("landslides", package = "RSAGA")


# DATA PREPROCESSING

# landslide points
non = landslides[landslides$lslpts == FALSE, ]
ind = sample(1:nrow(non), nrow(landslides[landslides$lslpts == TRUE, ]))
lsl = rbind(non[ind, ], landslides[landslides$lslpts == TRUE, ])

# digital elevation model

  raster(dem$data, 
         crs = "+proj=utm +zone=17 +south +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs",
         xmn = dem$header$xllcorner, 
         xmx = dem$header$xllcorner + dem$header$ncols * dem$header$cellsize,
         ymn = dem$header$yllcorner,
         ymx = dem$header$yllcorner + dem$header$nrows * dem$header$cellsize)

2. Make a spatial prediction map similar with the derived model results and terrain attribute rasters.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# attach packages
library(raster)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
# attach data (in case you have not computed the terrain attributes before)
# load("extdata/spatialcv.Rdata")

# fit the model
fit = glm(lslpts ~ slope + cplan + cprof + elev + log_carea, 
          data = lsl, family = binomial())

# make the prediction
pred = raster::predict(object = ta, model = fit, type = "response")

# make the map
lsl_sf = st_as_sf(lsl, coords = c("x", "y"), crs = 32717)
hs = hillShade(ta$slope * pi / 180, terrain(ta$elev, opt = "aspect"))
rect = tmaptools::bb_poly(hs)
bbx = tmaptools::bb(hs, xlim = c(-0.02, 1), ylim = c(-0.02, 1), relative = TRUE)
tm_shape(hs, bbox = bbx) +
  tm_grid(col = "black", n.x = 1, n.y = 1, labels.inside.frame = FALSE,
          labels.rot = c(0, 90)) +
  tm_raster(palette = "white", legend.show = FALSE) +
  # hillshade
  tm_shape(mask(hs, study_area), bbox = bbx) +
	tm_raster(palette = gray(0:100 / 100), n = 100, legend.show = FALSE) +
	# prediction raster
  tm_shape(mask(pred, study_area)) +
	tm_raster(alpha = 0.5, palette = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(name = "Reds", 6),
	          auto.palette.mapping = FALSE, legend.show = TRUE,
	          title = "Susceptibility\nprobability") +
	# rectangle and outer margins
  qtm(rect, fill = NULL) +
	tm_layout(outer.margins = c(0.04, 0.04, 0.02, 0.02), frame = FALSE,
	          legend.position = c("left", "bottom"),
	          legend.title.size = 0.9)
```

3. Compute a non-spatial cross-validation and make boxplots to compare the AUROC from a spatial and a non-spatial CV (see Figure \@ref(fig:boxplot-cv)).
Hint: You need to specify a non-spatial task and a non-spatial resampling strategy.
Before running the spatial cross-validation for both tasks set a seed to make sure that both use the same partitions which in turn guarantees comparability.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# attach packages
library(mlr)
# attach data (in case you have not computed the terrain attributes before)
# load("extdata/spatialcv.Rdata")

# put the coordinates in an additional dataframe
coords = lsl[, c("x", "y")]
data = dplyr::select(lsl, -x, -y)
# data_nonspatial = dplyr::select(data, -x, -y)

# CREATE TASKS
#*************

# spatial task
task = makeClassifTask(data = data, target = "lslpts", 
                       positive = "TRUE", coordinates = coords)
# non-spatial task
task_nsp = makeClassifTask(data = data, target = "lslpts", positive = "TRUE")

# CONSTRUCT LEARNER
#******************

lrn = makeLearner(cl = "classif.binomial",
                  link = "logit",
                  predict.type = "prob")

# DEFINE RESAMPLING STRATEGY

                      resampling = resampling,

                        resampling = resampling_nsp,

        conv_cv$measures.test$auc, col = c("lightblue2", "mistyrose2"),

```

4. Model landslide susceptibility using a quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA).
Assess the predictive performance of the QDA. 
What is the a difference between the spatially cross-validated mean AUROC value of the QDA and the GLM?
Hint: Before running the spatial cross-validation for both learners set a seed to make sure that both use the same partitions which in turn guarantees comparability.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# attach packages
library(mlr)
# attach data (in case you have not computed the terrain attributes before)
